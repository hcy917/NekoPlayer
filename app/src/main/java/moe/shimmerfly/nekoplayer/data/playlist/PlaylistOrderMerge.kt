package moe.shimmerfly.nekoplayer.data.playlist

/**
 * Applies a reorder of the songs a playlist currently shows to its full stored order.
 *
 * The detail screen only lists songs that resolve in the library right now, so songs in
 * excluded folders, on unmounted storage or on a signed-out server are missing from
 * [newVisibleOrder]. Visible slots in [storedIds] take the new order one by one, and every
 * hidden id keeps its original position.
 *
 * Playlists may contain the same id more than once, so the visible ids are compared as a
 * multiset. Returns null when [newVisibleOrder] is not a permutation of the visible stored
 * entries, for example when it holds an id that is not stored or drops one occurrence.
